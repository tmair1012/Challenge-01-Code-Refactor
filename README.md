# Challenge-One-Code-Refactor

This project contains the logic necessary to view the "Horiseon" main webpage

HTML and CSS were changed to avoid redundences by adding proper IDs and Classes to each section.

HTML divs were changed to proper semantic markup

Images were given an alt attribute

Title was change from website to Horiseon

CSS now falls in proper sequencial order of HTML and has more detailed named sections and IDs so developers can better know what they are adjusting and looking at.

There wasn't too many challenges in this project, rather the biggest challenges was locating redundencies to properly tighten up HTML and CSS code.
